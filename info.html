  <p><strong>Creators & Developers: The Infinite List</strong></p>

  <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
  <p>Welcome to the official Trust My Brother Nikolai Prank App Info Page. Below you will find a never-ending list of credits, disclaimers, random facts, fake departments, and anything else to waste your time. Enjoy scrolling!</p>

  <!-- Repeat block multiple times -->
  <!-- You can add more or copy this pattern to make it even longer! -->

  <!-- Block 1 -->
  <p>Nikolai A. Fambrough — Supreme prank commander and ultimate mischief coordinator.</p>
  <p>Ada Lovelace — First programmer in history, still writing imaginary code for this app.</p>
  <p>Alan Turing — Cracking codes and generating fake nonsense paragraphs since 1912.</p>
  <p>Isaac Newton — Discovered gravity and dropped the idea for this prank right on your computer.</p>
  <p>Albert Einstein — Came back just to say E=MC Prank.</p>
  <p>Elon Musk's clone — Managing the virtual hamster wheel servers.</p>
  <p>Professor Whiskers the cat — Head of useless ideas and snack breaks.</p>
  <p>Cookie Monster — Ate all the cookies, so you get none.</p>

  <!-- Block 2 -->
  <p>Disclaimer: The following paragraphs exist purely to make you scroll more than you ever have before. The more you scroll, the more you trust your brother, Nikolai.</p>
  <p>Warning: Excessive scrolling may result in finger cramps, eye rolling, and a sudden urge to yell “Seriously?!”</p>
  <p>Legal Department: This prank is certified by the International Bureau of Useless Pranks, 100% harmless and 200% silly.</p>
  <p>Did you know? The average person blinks 15-20 times a minute, which is still less than how many times you’ll roll your eyes reading this.</p>
  <p>Fun Fact: There’s absolutely nothing useful here. Seriously. Not a single line.</p>
  <p>Research Team: 10,000 imaginary researchers contributed to making this the longest prank info page in your family’s history.</p>
