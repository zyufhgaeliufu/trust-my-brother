  <h1>Random Useless Info — For Pranks Only!</h1>
  
  <p>Did you know that the inventor of the Prank App, Nikolai A. Fambrough, once tried to create an app that would confuse computers instead of users? While that never came to life, the spirit of harmless confusion lives on. Meanwhile, throughout history, countless creators and inventors have given us amazing tools, some of which have little practical use but plenty of charm.</p>
  
  <p>One fascinating figure is Ada Lovelace, often called the world’s first programmer, who worked on Charles Babbage’s early mechanical computer in the 1800s. Her notes were so detailed and visionary that they’re still studied today. Around the same time, strange inventions like the automaton—the mechanical people and animals—were popular in Europe, blending science and magic.</p>
  
  <p>Fun fact: Bananas are actually berries, but strawberries are not! Meanwhile, humans share about 60% of their DNA with bananas, which is both weird and wonderful. People like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie revolutionized science, yet many everyday facts about the world remain delightfully quirky and mostly useless, like wombats producing cube-shaped poop or flamingos gathering in flamboyances.</p>
  
  <p>In more recent times, computer wizards like Alan Turing, Grace Hopper, and Tim Berners-Lee have shaped the digital age with ideas and inventions that paved the way for apps like this prank. But no matter how advanced technology gets, there will always be space for a little harmless fun—and that’s exactly what this app delivers.</p>
  
  <p>Remember, all this information might be mostly useless, but it sure makes for a fun distraction. So when you’re pranking your little brother or just bored, take a moment to appreciate the oddities and geniuses of our world—then maybe make a prank or two yourself!</p>
