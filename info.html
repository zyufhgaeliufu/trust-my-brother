  <p><strong>Creators & Developers</strong></p>

  <p>This amazing application was conceptualized by Nikolai A. Fambrough, lead prankster and supreme overseer of jokes and harmless chaos.</p>

  <p>Contributions by an imaginary team of 500 world-class developers, including Ada Lovelace, Nikola Tesla, and the Ghost of Alan Turing, who dedicated countless hours to ensuring this program achieves absolutely nothing useful.</p>

  <p>Our dedicated marketing and research teams, spearheaded by Marie Curie and Isaac Newton, worked tirelessly to test this prank on countless virtual machines to confirm its harmless yet hilariously confusing effects.</p>

  <p>The cybersecurity department, managed by Elon Musk’s clone and the reanimated brain of Albert Einstein, verified that this file poses zero real risk and is purely for comedic purposes. Also, they invented this paragraph just to make it look longer.</p>

  <p>The design was inspired by the legendary Blue Screen of Death, with additional design advice from a talking cat named Professor Whiskers who specializes in practical jokes and digital mischief.</p>

  <p>Disclaimer: This prank has not been certified by any official prank association, union, or global council of mischief. Any resemblance to actual viruses, malware, or catastrophic system failures is purely coincidental and for entertainment only.</p>

  <p>Additional credits go to: the invisible hamster that runs the servers, the magic 8-ball that made key decisions during development, and the imaginary friend you forgot about when you turned 7 years old.</p>

  <p>Fun fact: 99% of people reading this will never get this far, but if you did, you deserve a cookie. Sadly, the cookie is virtual, and you cannot eat it. But hey, here’s another paragraph to waste your time!</p>

  <p>This line exists solely to make this page longer. If you are still reading, you must really trust your brother or you’re just extremely bored. Either way, you’re awesome.</p>

  <p>Remember: By downloading this file, you agree that you trust your brother unconditionally, and you fully accept the risk of mild confusion, giggling, and possibly yelling, “NIKOLAI!” really loudly.</p>

  <p>If you made it all the way down here, congratulations. Why not download the file again, just in case you want to see the Blue Screen of Death one more time? It’s free, 100% useless, and slightly entertaining.</p>
