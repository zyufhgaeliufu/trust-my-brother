  <h1>Here's everything that's wrong with you:</h1>

  <p>You’re lazy. So lazy you probably didn’t even read this properly.</p>
  <p>You’re mean — but only when you don’t get your way.</p>
  <p>You leave snack wrappers everywhere. Seriously, pick them up for once.</p>
  <p>You trust your brother way too much — look where that got you.</p>
  <p>You always borrow stuff and never give it back. We know.</p>
  <p>You think you’re clever — but you just fell for a silly prank site.</p>
  <p>You probably haven’t showered today. Go check. Ew.</p>
  <p>You rolled your eyes like five times already reading this. Good.</p>
  <p>Did you really think clicking “Do you trust your brother???” was smart? Guess not.</p>
  <p>This line exists just to keep you scrolling. It’s working, isn’t it?</p>
  <p>Congrats, you made it to the bottom. Now go get your brother back!</p>
